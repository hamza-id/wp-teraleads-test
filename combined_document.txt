HAMZA MAC - PROJECT SUBMISSION DOCUMENT

================================================================================
TERALEADS TEST PROJECT
================================================================================

• This is a web application that shows Google reviews for different places in a sliding carousel format that moves automatically
• The application gets reviews from Google Places API which is a service that provides information about businesses and locations
• I have added reference images in the Screenshots folder to show how the application looks on different devices
• The app comes with popular places already set up so you can test it right away without any setup
• It uses PHP backend to handle Google Places API calls and avoid CORS issues because calling directly from JavaScript without any package like Express won't work due to security reasons
• The design works well on both mobile phones and desktop computers as requested in the original document
• It has carousel navigation with arrow buttons and pagination dots so users can control the movement
• It can work with any Google Place ID from anywhere in the world
• The carousel moves by itself every 5 seconds to show different reviews continuously
• Users can also move the carousel manually using the arrow buttons or pagination dots
• On mobile phones it shows 2 items in each row while on desktop computers it shows 4 items in each row as specified
• The server-side API calls prevent Google Places API security errors that would normally occur
• It comes with popular Dubai locations like Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa already set up for testing purposes

For execution instructions, please follow the README.md file.
